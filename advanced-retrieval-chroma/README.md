# Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma ðŸš€

**Information Retrieval (IR)** and **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** are only effective if the information retrieved from a database as a result of a query is relevant to the query and its application. 

However, challenges abound:  
- Queries often yield results that are **close in meaning** but fail to directly address the posed question.  
- Worse, irrelevant material can distract the **LLM** from finding the correct answers. ðŸ˜“ 

## Key Techniques for Enhanced Retrieval ðŸ”‘: 
1. **Query Expansion ðŸ› :**
   - Broaden user queries by including **related concepts and keywords** to enhance retrieval.  
   - Supercharge this traditional approach by leveraging an **LLM** to generate related terms or even suggest **possible answers** to include in the query. 
2. **Cross-Encoder Reranking ðŸ“Š:**  
   - Refine retrieval by **reranking results** to surface the most relevant ones for the query. This method ensures that the results are prioritized and tailored to your needs.

3. **Training & Utilizing Embedding Adapters ðŸ”„:**  
   - Adding an adapter layer to reshape embeddings emphasizes elements most relevant to specific applications, enhancing retrieval performance.

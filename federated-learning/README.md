# Federated Learning 🌐

A practical guide to training AI models across distributed data while preserving privacy and optimizing efficiency. Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data, making it a cornerstone for privacy-preserving AI development.

## Key Concepts and Techniques 🔑

1. **Why Federated Learning? 🤔**  
   - Train models across devices or organizations without transmitting raw data.  
   - Enhance privacy and security while enabling practical applications like mobile keyboard predictions.

2. **Federated Training Process 🛠**  
   - Understand the steps to build and execute federated learning projects.  
   - Use tools like Flower and PyTorch to customize and tune training workflows.

3. **Tuning and Customization 🎛**  
   - Optimize federated learning projects for specific use cases.  
   - Address challenges like computational resource constraints and model performance.

4. **Data Privacy 🔒**  
   - Explore techniques like Private Enhancing Technologies (PETs) in the context of federated learning.
   - Explore two types of differential privacy – central and local – along with the dual approach of clipping and noising to protect private data.

5. **Bandwidth Optimization 🌐**  
   - Explore the bandwidth requirements for federated learning and how you can optimize it by reducing the update size and communication frequency.

6. **Federated LLM Fine-Tuning 🧠**
   - Understand the importance of safely training LLMs using private data.
   - Learn about the limitations of current training data and how Federated LLM Fine-tuning can help overcome these challenges.
   - Build an LLM that is fine-tuned with private medical data to answer complex questions, showcasing the benefits of federated methods when using private data.
   - Learn how federated LLM fine-tuning works and how it simplifies access to private data, reduces bandwidth with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), and increases privacy to training data with Differential Privacy.

Understand how LLMs can leak training data and how federated LLMs can lower this risk.

# Prompt Engineering with Llama 2 & 3 ðŸš€

A comprehensive guide to interacting with Meta's **Llama 2 & 3 models**, including **Llama 2 Chat**, **Code Llama**, and **Llama Guard**, to enhance productivity and ensure responsible AI use.

## Key Techniques for Effective Prompting ðŸ”‘

1. **Few-Shot Prompting ðŸ› **  
   - Classify text sentiment by providing a few examples to the model.  
   - Tailor responses for specific use cases using minimal input examples.

2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting ðŸ“Š**  
   - Solve logical problems by guiding the model through step-by-step reasoning.  
   - Improve accuracy for tasks requiring complex thought processes.

3. **Code Llama for Pair Programming ðŸ’»**  
   - Leverage Code Llama for collaborative programming tasks.  
   - Enhance code writing, debugging, and optimization with AI assistance.

4. **Safe AI with Llama Guard ðŸ›¡**  
   - Detect harmful content in prompts and responses using Llama Guard.  
   - Integrate Llama Guard into workflows to maintain safety and reliability.
